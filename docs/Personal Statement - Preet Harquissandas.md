## Summary
Each individual's personal statement explaining what you contributed, a reflection about what you have learned in this project, mistakes you made, special design decisions, and what you might do differently if you were to do it again or have more time. This statement must be succinct and to the point, yet must include sufficient details for me to check against the commit history of the repo so that any claims can be verified. Including links to a selection of specific commits that demonstrate your work would be most helpful. If you work with another member of your group on a module, make sure to give them co-author credit. Additionally, try to make meaningful commit messages.
