#risc64-unknown-elf-as is an assembler for riscv
#-march=rv32im sets the ISA to be used in this case / the instructions that will be accepted
#-mabi=ilp32 sets the ABI (application binary interface) which defines the purpose of specific registers, its set to ILP32 here
#riscv64-unknown-elf-ld is the gnu linker it links together different files to create an executable file
# -o "a.out" "input_file" says the output of the assembler will be stored in the file a.out and the source code file is $input_file
#the linker will output to a.out.reloc with the source file being a.out, Ttext specifies the text start address, melf32lriscv tells the linker
#the objects being linked are 32-bit RISC-V code
# a.out.reloc is the executable that can be loaded to the processor's instruction memory
#-e is the entry point, the  address where the execution of the program begins - i.e. i think at what addresses to begin writing the output
#-O binary means we write the output file in binary format
#-j .text "a.out.reloc" "a.bin" copies only sections matching .text from a.out.reloc and writes it to a.bin

#objdump displays information from object files
# -f means display summary infromation from the overall header of each of the objfile files
# -d means disassemble, it displays the assembler mnemonics for the machine instructions from the input file

# -m specifies the architecture to use when disassembling the object files in this case riscv

# Formats into a hex file
# od -v means we will write all input data even if its duplicated, -An specifies the input address base as no address
#-t is to specify the output format, x1 means x = hexadecimal and 1 is the size specifier here its 4 which represents the byte count, so we will
#output the hex 8 hex digits at a time
#"a.bin" is the input file
#tr is translate
#awk scans through the input file for lines matching a set of specified paterns
#$1 denotes a field, with an input line being made up of fields seperated by white space or by the regular expressions
#awk '{$1=$1};1' rewrites a.bin removing whitespace and outputs it to ${output_file}
