## Overview of Repository Structure

This repository is organized to contain all deliverables, separating source code, verification files, and documentation. All core processor designs are contained within the **`rtl`** folder.

| Directory | Content | Deliverable Requirement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`rtl`** | All SystemVerilog source code for the processor. Different architectural versions (Single-Cycle, Pipelined, Cached, etc.) are managed using Git branches/tags. **Each branch contains a separate `rtl/README.md` which provides a detailed explanation of the CPU design specific to that branch (e.g., hazard control, pipeline stages, or cache design).** | **Required.** Includes `rtl/README.md` listing module authorship. |
| **`tb`** | Testbench environment, including assembly programs, verification setup, and the **`Makefile`** for building/testing. | **Required.** Includes evidence and build automation. |
| **`personal_statements`** | Individual reflection and contribution reports. | **Required.**|
| **`README.md` (root)** | This joint team statement and project overview. | **Required.** |

## Important Notes and Critical Points

### Core Design Status
The highest level of achievement successfully verified is the **Cached Pipelined RV32I Design Supporting All Base RV32I Instruction Set** (Stretch Goal 1, 2 & 3).

### Critical Points for Assessment
1.  **Branch Management (Required):** All major processor versions are accessible via dedicated branches, which contain the correct design in the **`rtl`** folder:
    * **main** — Single-Cycle RV32I CPU with full RV32I base instruction support (Stretch Goal 3)  
    * **pipelined** — Five-stage pipelined RV32I CPU with full instruction support (Stretch Goals 1 & 3)  
    * **cached** — Pipelined CPU extended with a 2-way set-associative data cache (Stretch Goals 1, 2 & 3)  
    * **fpga** — FPGA-oriented variant of the pipelined design (special exploration)  
    * **superscalar** — Draft superscalar extension (advanced exploratory work)
2.  **Verification:** The **`cached`** design successfully passes:
    * The team's F1 starting light program.
    * The reference **`pdf.asm`** program (evidence below).
    * All five verification programs in the `tb/asm` folder.
3.  **Data Cache:** The implementation uses a **2-way set-associative data cache** with a capacity of **4096 bytes** (1k words) and LRU replacement.
4.  **Final Verification Status:** The **PDF calculation program** is now fully verified and correctly plots all four reference data distributions (`gaussian`, `noisy`, `triangle`, `sine`).

## Quick Start (Build and Run)

This section provides the essential commands for the assessor to build and verify your processor. We recommend running the full test suite on the **`cached`** branch, as it represents the highest level of achievement (Stretch Goal 2: Pipelined with Data Cache).

### 1. Setup and Build

The process requires switching to the target branch and building the processor model.

1.  **Check out the required branch** (e.g., for the highest achievement):
    ```bash
    git checkout cached
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the testbench folder:**
    ```bash
    cd tb
    ```

3.  **Build the Processor Model:**
    *This step compiles the source code in `rtl/` into the simulation environment.*
    ```bash
    ./build.sh # Use the name of your specific build script (e.g., ./doit.sh, ./f1.sh, ./pdf.sh)
    ```

### 2. Available Test Commands

The following shell scripts in the `tb` directory are used to run all verification programs and generate the required evidence.

> **Note on PDF Testing:** The individual distribution scripts (`gaussian.sh`, `triangle.sh`, etc.) have been consolidated into a single, flexible script, **`pdf.sh`**, which takes the data file as an argument. The commands below reflect the final, consolidated method.

| Command | Behaviour | Deliverable Requirement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `./doit.sh` | Runs **all** the required verification test benches (e.g., from `tb/tests`) to ensure the processor passes the **five mandated tests**. | **Required** (Verification of 5 tests) |
| `./f1.sh` | Runs the **`f1-lights`** program. The successful execution must be captured as video evidence. | **Required** (F1 program evidence) |
| `./pdf.sh reference/gaussian.mem` | Executes the `pdf.asm` program using the Gaussian data and plots the **bell-shaped** distribution. | Evidence / Demonstration |
| `./pdf.sh reference/triangle.mem` | Executes the `pdf.asm` program using the Triangle data and plots the **uniform or U-shaped** distribution. | Evidence / Demonstration |
| `./pdf.sh reference/noisy.mem` | Executes the `pdf.asm` program using the Noisy data and plots the **complex/multi-peaked** distribution. | Evidence / Demonstration |

## Overview of Achieved Goals

The team successfully implemented the Single-Cycle RV32I processor and progressed beyond the basic requirements by completing all **three stretch goals**. The highest verified milestone is the **Cached Five-Stage Pipelined RV32I Processor supporting the full RV32I base instruction set** (Stretch Goals 1, 2, and 3). Additional exploratory work was carried out on FPGA-oriented and superscalar variants.
