## Overview of Repository Structure

This repository is organized to contain all deliverables, separating source code, verification files, and documentation. All core processor designs are contained within the **`rtl`** folder.

| Directory | Content | Deliverable Requirement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`rtl`** | All SystemVerilog source code for the processor. Different architectural versions (Single-Cycle, Pipelined, Cached, etc.) are managed using Git branches/tags. **Each branch contains a separate `rtl/README.md` which provides a detailed explanation of the CPU design specific to that branch (e.g., hazard control, pipeline stages, or cache design).** | **Required.** Includes `rtl/README.md` listing module authorship. |
| **`tb`** | Testbench environment, including assembly programs, verification setup, and the **`Makefile`** for building/testing. | **Required.** Includes evidence and build automation. |
| **`personal_statements`** | Individual reflection and contribution reports. | **Required.**|
| **`README.md` (root)** | This joint team statement and project overview. | **Required.** |

## Important Notes and Critical Points

### Core Design Status
The highest level of achievement successfully verified is the **Cached Pipelined RV32I Design** (Stretch Goal 2).

### Critical Points for Assessment
1.  **Branch Management (Required):** All major processor versions are accessible via dedicated branches, which contain the correct design in the **`rtl`** folder:
    * **`main`**: Single-Cycle RV32I Design (Basic Goal)
    * **`pipelined`**: Pipelined RV32I Design (Stretch Goal 1)
    * **`cached`**: Pipelined + 2-Way Set-Associative Data Cache (Stretch Goal 2)
    * **`fpga`**: FPGA-optimized Pipelined Design (Specialized)
    * **`superscalar`**: Superscalar Pipelined Design (Advanced Extension)
2.  **Verification:** The **`cached`** design successfully passes:
    * The team's F1 starting light program.
    * The reference **`pdf.asm`** program (evidence below).
    * All five verification programs in the `tb/asm` folder.
3.  **Data Cache:** The implementation uses a **2-way set-associative data cache** with a capacity of **4096 bytes** (1k words) and LRU replacement.

## Quick Start (Build and Run)

This section provides the essential commands for the assessor to build and verify your processor. We recommend running the full test suite on the **`cached`** branch, as it represents the highest level of achievement (Stretch Goal 2: Pipelined with Data Cache).

### 1. Setup and Build

The process requires switching to the target branch and building the processor model.

1.  **Check out the required branch** (e.g., for the highest achievement):
    ```bash
    git checkout cached
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the testbench folder:**
    ```bash
    cd tb
    ```

3.  **Build the Processor Model:**
    *This step compiles the source code in `rtl/` into the simulation environment.*
    ```bash
    ./build.sh  # Use the name of your specific build script (eg ./doit.sh, ./f1.sh, ./gaussian.sh, ./triangle.sh, ./noisy.sh)
    ```

### 2. Available Test Commands

The following shell scripts in the `tb` directory are used to run all verification programs and generate the required evidence.

| Command | Behaviour | Deliverable Requirement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `./doit.sh` | Runs **all** the required verification test benches (e.g., from `tb/tests`) to ensure the processor passes the **five mandated tests**. | **Required** (Verification of 5 tests) |
| `./f1.sh` | Runs the **`f1-lights`** program. The successful execution must be captured as video evidence. | **Required** (F1 program evidence) |
| `./gaussian.sh` | Executes the program and plots the **`gaussian`** graph. | Evidence / Demonstration |
| `./triangle.sh` | Executes the program and plots the **`triangle`** graph. | Evidence / Demonstration |
| `./noisy.sh` | Executes the program and plots the **`noisy`** graph. | Evidence / Demonstration |

## Overview of Achieved Goals

The team successfully implemented the **Single-Cycle RV32I Design** and achieved **Stretch Goal 2** by implementing a **Pipelined Processor with a 2-way Set-Associative Data Cache**. Furthermore, specialized FPGA and Superscalar versions were explored.
